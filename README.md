Debug repository to experiment on difference between `push_patch` and `<.link patch>` behaviour.  
There is test setup with Wallaby for reproducing this issue that occurs on Javascript side of Phoenix. You can execute Wallaby-tests with `mix test`, just make sure you have `chromedriver` installed.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
